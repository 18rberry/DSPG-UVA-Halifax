### Examples Page

If you want to add in an image on an Rmd file, use this [link here](https://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/03/07/blogdown-insert-image-addin/). It ends up being a little tricky, but as long as you have created a folder to insert your images, you can just use some markdown code or html to insert images in the format you want. 

### Centering images  

![](/findings/results-section-one_files/hugo.png){style="width:20%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"}

### Placing images side-by-side

<img src="/findings/results-section-one_files/hugo.png" width="150"/> <img src="/findings/results-section-one_files/rmarkdown.png" width="150"/> <img src="/findings/results-section-one_files/min_night.png" width="175"/> <img src="/findings/results-section-one_files/netlify.png" width="175"/>
