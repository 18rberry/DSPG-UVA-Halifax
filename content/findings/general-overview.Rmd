While this page is *optional*, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website: 

### Main Findings 

[Here you will describe the results and include important visualizations from your project.] 

### Conclusion and Policy Implications 

[Here you could highlight the main takeaways and the potential policy implications of your findings.] 

### References 

[List your references here using APA format (or at least standardize all of the references using the same format).]
