<h3>2020 Halifax County Summer Project</h3>
<p>The United States incarcerates more people per capita than anywhere else in the world,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and a disproportionate number of those incarcerated are Black and Hispanic.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Estimates from the ACLU suggest that one of every three Black males and one out of every six Latino males will be incarcerated, compared to only one out of seventeen for White males.</p>
<p>In addition to the drastic human costs incurred by these mass incarceration policies, the current incarceration rate is extremely costly for taxpayers. The U.S. spends roughtly $60 to $80 billion per year on state and federal prisons.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><span class="math inline">\(^,\)</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> But despite these expenditures, roughly two-thirds of individuals released from prison were re-arrested within three years.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Halifax County, Virginia, is not immune to these national trends. Halifax County spends over $400,000</p>
<p><em>(X PERCENT OF BUDGET) </em></p>
<p><em>Finn asks: Where are these values coming from? This is not consistent with what's in the budget from Nat</em></p>
<p>on incarceration and recidivism annually, and this figure still does not account for the many indirect costs that result from incarceration, like foster care services required when parents are removed from the home or costs related to drug addiction treatment.</p>
<p>Halifax County has partnered with DSPG 2020 to investigate the factors associated with its incarceration and recidivism rate in the hopes of investing in proactive services through the Virginia Cooperative Extension Service, like a Family and Consumer Science Agent. Among other things, this position would help connect formerly incarcerated individuals to the community resources needed to help them effectively re-enter society.</p>

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<p>Our primary goals for the summer have been to synthesize a variety of research to identify key social determinants of incarceration and recidivism as well as to identify accessible data sources that would allow us to characterize the state of these determinants in Halifax County.</p>
<p>We hope that identifying emerging patterns in these determinants will allow Halifax to more specifically target those factors that are most relevant to the state of incarceration and recidivism in the county.</p>

<div id="our-approach" class="section level3">
<h3>Our Approach</h3>
<p>Under this framework, our approach centered around an extensive literature review of research in the area, a comprehensive exploration and accumulation of available data sources on key factors impacting arrest and incarceration, and data visualizations to communicate the state of these factors in Halifax County, VA.</p>
<p>While we cannot make definitive conclusions on how these factors influence arrests and incarceration based on our visualizations, this project provides a foundation for Halifax County to build upon as it attempts to improve the state of incarceration within its borders. We hope to connect the county with existing relevant data sources and identify the data required for a more comprehensive view of the issue to emerge.</p>
