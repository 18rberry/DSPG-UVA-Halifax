      <description>Background Despite being previously overshadowed in the literature, housing affordability has recently begun to situate itself at the center of efforts to transition incarcerated people back into the community after release. Many now see access to affordable housing as one of the primary limiting factors for reentering individuals; an unstable living situation can severely impact employment opportunities, predispose individuals to returning to criminal activity, and hinder efforts to reestablish family relationships and friendships1.</description>

      <description>Background In many states and communities, substance abuse related felonies make up a large amount of convictions. As stated by a publication from Georgetown’s Journal on Poverty Law and Policy, ¾ state prisoners and ⅘ federal prisoners are alcohol/drug involved offenders. Additionally, 58% of state prisoners and 63% of sentenced jail inmates met the criteria for drug dependence or abuse, compared to 5% of the total adult population.</description>

      <description>Our ecological model framework encouraged us to consider how these various factors may interact in their effects on re-entry for formely incarcerated individuals in Halifax County.
A key component of each factor is resource accessibliity: employment opportunities, availabile affordable housing options, and support for those with substance abuse problems are all rendered irrelevant if these resources are not accessible to those who rely on them.</description>
