      <title>Crime &#43; Arrests</title>

      <description>Background Crime, arrest, and incarceration are related but distinct concepts. Crimes occur when individuals break the law, but not all crimes come to the attention of law enforcement. Of the crimes that do come to the attention of law enforcement, some are diverted from formal proceedings and others result in arrest. Again, not all arrests result in incarceration. The below figure from the Prison Fellowship highlights how the process from arrest to incarceration makes it difficult to compare the rates of crime, arrests, and incarceration directly.</description>

      <description>Background A discussion of factors related to incarceration would be remiss without discussing unemployment. Empirical analyses have consistently found unemployment to be one of the factors most strongly correlated with crime. A 2005 meta-analysis of over 200 studies quantifying predictors of crime found that local unemployment rates had the second-largest effect size out of 31 predictors.1 There are several reasonable theories as to why this is true.</description>

      <description>Background Many now see access to affordable housing as one of the primary factors limiting successful re-entry for individuals leaving jails or prisons; an unstable living situation can severely impact employment opportunities, predispose individuals to return to criminal activity, and hinder efforts to reestablish family relationships and friendships1.
Using the ecological model as a framework, we can see how housing impacts an individuals re-entry. At the policy level, eligibility for low-income housing opportunities may be limited by prior convictions (despite HUD recommendations to the contrary)2.</description>

      <description>Background In many states and communities, substance abuse related felonies make up a large amount of convictions. As stated by a publication from Georgetown’s Journal on Poverty Law and Policy, ¾ state prisoners and ⅘ federal prisoners are alcohol/drug involved offenders. Additionally, 58% of state prisoners and 63% of sentenced jail inmates met the criteria for drug dependence or abuse, compared to 5% of the total adult population.</description>
