      <description>Background Approximately three out of four state prisoners and four out of five federal prisoners are detained for alcohol and or drug related offenses1. Additionally, 58% of state prisoners and 63% of sentenced jail inmates meet the criteria for substance abuse disorders (SUDs), compared to 5% of the general adult population2. Not considered in these figures is the high rate of drug-related crime; for example, 17% of state prisoners and 18% of federal inmates committed their offense to obtain money to purchase drugs3.</description>
