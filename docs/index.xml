      <description>Our ecological model framework encouraged us to consider how these various factors may interact in their effects on re-entry for formely incarcerated individuals in Halifax County.
A key component of each factor is resource accessibliity: employment opportunities, availabile affordable housing options, and support for those with substance abuse problems are all rendered irrelevant if these resources are not accessible to those who rely on them.</description>

      <description>UVA Data Science for the Public Good Program The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars program is a summer immersive program held at the Biocomplexity Instituteâ€™s Social and Decision Analytics division (SDAD). In its seventh year, the program engages students from across the country to work together on projects that address state, federal, and local government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today. DSPG young scholars conduct research at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences to determine how information generated within every community can be leveraged to improve quality of life and inform public policy.</description>

      <description>h1, h2, h3 { text-align: center; } body { text-align: justify }  2020 Halifax County Summer Project The United States incarcerates more people per capita than anywhere else in the world (Sentencing Project), and a disproportionate number of those incarcerated are Black and Hispanic (APA). Estimates from the ACLU suggest that one of every three Black males and one out of every six Latino males will be incarcerated, compared to only one out of seventeen for white males.</description>
